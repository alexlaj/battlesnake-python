A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Python. Available live at [a1b1.herokuapp.com](http://a1b1.herokuapp.com).

To get started you'll need a working Python 2.7.6+ development environment and should be familiar with [deploying Python apps to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction).

This AI client uses the [bottle web framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) for route management and response building, and the [gunicorn web server](http://gunicorn.org/) for running bottle on Heroku.
